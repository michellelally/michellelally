### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

- I'm looking to grow my web development skills for side projects by taking part in an evening course on Web Development.

  - Willow Works, an e-commerce website for a friend to advertise and sell their carpentry services based in Co. Limerick.
  
  - Ruby Productions, because why not have all of your best videographer work in an online portfolio! 
  
  - Online Art Gallery, showcasing an online exhibition of my friends amazing paintings to help her with gaining some recognition and possible sales.

- Also working testing my mobile app development knowledge for a couple of passion projects I've always wanted to do! 

   - An interactive cocktail menu  for a local bar using React Native
   
   - Recommendation system in machine learning, image processing, object detection or something else ML related!

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

React

  - I have only began building React web applications a few months ago and I am thoroughly enjoying discovering what this JavaScript library is capable of. Having become very comfortable with using React.js, I plan on moving on to learning React Native in the coming weeks to build a native app based on an existing project.  
DevOpsSec

  - DevOps is a software development model which evolved to keep up with the ever changing ways of software delivery by implementing CI/CD practices. Using AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy and CodePipeline to save developers the hassle manual coding tests and deploying and releasing a products.

Angular

  - As part of my ongoing Udemy course in Angular, I am learning how to build a real e-commerce app with Angular, Firebase and Bootstrap. By the end of watching     the course, I'll be able to build real client apps with Angular, troubleshoot common compile-time and run-time errors, write clean and maintainable code like a professional and apply best practices when building Angular apps 


### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with

Tensorflow 

  - My interest in this machine learning platform began a few years ago when I first began studying software development, and it has never left my mind. I'd love to build and train my own model so I was thinking of beginning with something similar to Hotdog or Not Hotdog, what do yoy think?

React

  - After seeing this JavaScript library popping up everywhere in job ads I thought that based on my interest in Angular and after a bit of research into this technology and discovering it's supposedly easier to learn than Angular that I should give it a go so any advice would be greatly appreciated.   

Apache Kafka

  - This event-streaming platform is amazing technology that I have recently become really interested in learning. I have been reading documentation and some Github repositories with projects based on Kafka and I look forward to recieving and advice or help that anyone may have for me to get started!

### âš¡ Interests and Hobbies

Other than learning about software and web development, I like to: 

  - Travel. It's all I've ever wanted to do. I am constantly longing to experience a new culture and see a different city. 
  
  - Hiking. Similar feeling I have towards hiking as I do about travelling. Seeing and experiencing somewhere different.
  
  - Piano. An instrument I have always loved listening to but only began self-learning in the last few months and I love it.
  
  - Calligraphy. Also a new skill I have picked up since lockdown which I have surprised myself at how quickly I am picking up this craft.
  
  - Cook. Expanding my knowledge of delicious vegetarian and vegan recipes has always been a pleasure of mine. 
  
  - Read. Something I took up recently to try limit my screen time. I'm almost finished the ASOIF series and already planning my next reads. 
  
  - Reddit. I read about world news, watch funny animal videos and learn from other programmers through this community of forums.
