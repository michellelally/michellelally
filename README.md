Angular

  - As part of my ongoing Udemy course in Angular, I am learning how to build a real e-commerce app with Angular, Firebase and Bootstrap. By the end of watching     the course, I'll be able to build real client apps with Angular, troubleshoot common compile-time and run-time errors, write clean and maintainable code like a professional and apply best practices when building Angular apps 

Computing Fundamentals

  - I will also be completing modules in Object Oriented Software Engineering, Databases, Web Design and Client Side Scripting and Software Development as part of the evening course I'm enrolled to extend my knowledge on web development but also to refresh my memory on software development principles. 

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...

React

  - I have been seeing this JavaScript library popping up everywhere recently and I thought that based on my interest in Angular and after a bit of research into this technology and discovering it's supposedly easier to learn than Angular that I should give it a go so any advice on where to begin would be appreciated.   

Apache Kafka

  - This event-streaming platform is amazing technology that I have recently become really interested in learning. I have been reading documentation and some Github repositories with projects based on Kafka and I look forward to recieving and advice or help that anyone may have for me to get started!

### âš¡ Interests and Hobbies: ...

Other than learning about software and web development, I like to: 

  - Travel. It's all I've ever wanted to do. I am constantly longing to experience a new culture and see a different city. 
  
  - Hiking. Similar feeling I have towards hiking as I do about travelling. Seeing and experiencing somewhere different.
  
  - Piano. An instrument I have always loved listening to but only began self-learning in the last few months and I love it.
  
  - Calligraphy. Also a new skill I have picked up since lockdown which I have surprised myself at how quickly I am picking up this craft.
  
  - Cook. Expanding my knowledge of delicious vegetarian and vegan recipes has always been a pleasure of mine. 
  
  - Read. Something I took up recently to try limit my screen time. I am almost finished the ASOIF series and already planning my next reads. 
  
  - Reddit. I read about world news, watch funny animal videos and learn from other programmers through this community of forums.
